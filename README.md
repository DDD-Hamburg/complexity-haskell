As you may know, Haskell is very smart on figuring out what is needed to make your project work. 
For example it will automatically download  different compiler version depending on the libraries that you're using.
It's enough to point to the current folder and write:
    
    * stack build
    
To start your Haskell app:

    $ stack ghci
    Prelude> :load Main
    *Main> main
    Starting Server...
    Setting phasers to stun... (port 3000) (ctrl-c to quit)
